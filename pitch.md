# REVACHOL NIGHTS — Game Pitch Document

**Dead Cells meets Disco Elysium**

*A noir detective roguelite where your psyche is the build and the truth depends on who you are.*

## THE HOOK

*[HYPE speaks]*

### Elevator Pitch

**Every time you die, your personality reshuffles — and the murder you're solving changes with it.**

### Scroll-Stop Line

> "I solved the same case five times. Got five different killers. All of them were right."

### The "Oh, That's Cool" Moment

Picture this: the detective dies in a rain-slicked alley. The screen fractures. Personality traits — AUTHORITY, EMPATHY, LOGIC, ELECTROCHEMISTRY — scatter like shattered glass and reassemble in a new configuration. The camera pulls back from the detective's eyes as they snap open at their desk, cigarette still burning. The HUD morphs: where there were heavy melee combos, now there are evasion dashes and psychic-read abilities. Same precinct. Same city. Different you. Different truth.

That is a 5-second GIF that stops every scroll on every feed.

## THE CORE

*[REED speaks]*

### Core Loop

**30-second loop**: Enter a procedurally arranged district of Revachol. Encounter hostiles (suspects, corrupt cops, hallucinated manifestations of your psyche). Fight using a combat kit derived from your dominant personality facets. Every encounter drops INSIGHT fragments — clues that are simultaneously narrative progression AND mechanical upgrades.

**5-minute loop**: Clear a district. Choose a path deeper into the case. Spend Insight to unlock dialogue nodes with key witnesses/suspects OR upgrade your combat abilities — the same resource fuels both, forcing a constant tension between *understanding the case* and *surviving the city*.

**Session loop (20-40 minutes)**: Reach a case conclusion (or die). Your conclusion shapes the meta-case — a larger conspiracy that only becomes visible across multiple runs. Death reshuffles your PSYCHE BUILD (the 24 personality skills from DE's system, collapsed into 4 combat archetypes with 6 sub-skills each). New psyche = new combat kit = new dialogue options = new case interpretation. Begin again.

### Core Mechanics

1. **Psyche Build System**: Your personality IS your loadout. Authority grants heavy melee and crowd control. Empathy grants evasion, ally buffs, and enemy-read telegraphs. Logic grants trap placement and environmental exploitation. Electrochemistry grants speed, crits, and high-risk/high-reward berserker states. Each run randomly weights these four, creating hybrid builds.

2. **Insight Economy**: One resource, two uses. Spend Insight on combat upgrades to survive harder districts, or spend it on narrative unlocks to interrogate witnesses and uncover case threads. You can never afford both fully. This is the central strategic tension.

3. **Case Refraction**: The same murder case viewed through different psychological lenses yields different evidence, different suspects, different truths. An Authority-dominant run sees the case as a power struggle. An Empathy-dominant run sees it as a tragedy of broken relationships. Mechanically, your dominant stat determines which evidence nodes are even VISIBLE to you.

4. **Internal Voices (Active Combat Ability)**: Your non-dominant personality facets manifest as "voices" during combat — brief pop-up skill checks that interrupt the action. Succeed and you get a temporary buff or narrative fragment. Fail and you take psychic damage. These are fast, contextual, and feel like your mind arguing with itself mid-fight.

5. **Meta-Case Persistence**: Across runs, certain truths persist. A conspiracy board in your precinct office accumulates connections. No single run reveals the full picture. The meta-case is the long-term motivation — Dead Cells' boss cell progression meets a detective's growing obsession.

### What Mastery Looks Like

A beginner button-mashes through combat and picks narrative options randomly, reaching shallow case conclusions. An expert reads the psyche build they've been dealt, identifies which evidence nodes this build can access, optimizes Insight spending to unlock the *specific* narrative threads that connect to their meta-case board, and uses Internal Voices as combat multipliers rather than interruptions. The expert plays the detective AND the game simultaneously — they're solving the case AND optimizing the run.

The depth ceiling is enormous: mastery means understanding that your psyche isn't a constraint — it's a lens. Every build has access to truths the others can't see. The 100-hour player isn't better at combat; they're better at *reading themselves*.

### Unique Mechanic

**Case Refraction** — the idea that the mystery itself is subjective and mechanically changes based on your psychological profile. Other roguelites randomize levels, enemies, and items. Revachol Nights randomizes *the truth*. No other game makes "who you are" determine "what happened." This is the system that makes the DE + Dead Cells fusion more than a mashup — it's a thesis statement about perception and justice.

## THE HEART

*[NOVA speaks]*

### Theme

**Beneath the plot, this game is about the unreliability of the self.**

We think we see the world clearly. We think our version of events is the true one. Revachol Nights asks: what if the detective is the variable? What if the case doesn't change — you do? And what if every version of you is telling the truth?

This is a game about identity as a lens, justice as a construct, and the terrifying possibility that objectivity is a myth. The player doesn't solve a murder. They solve *themselves* — and the murder follows.

### The World

Revachol is a city that remembers everything and understands nothing. It is a place where every revolution failed, where every ideology left a scar, and where the rain never quite washes the old posters off the walls. The architecture is brutalist-meets-art-nouveau — crumbling grandeur with neon stapled to its corpse. It exists in a perpetual twilight that feels like 3 AM in a city that peaked in 1979.

The wound of Revachol is *collective disillusionment*. Everyone here once believed in something. The city is what happens after belief dies but the believers don't.

The aesthetic channels 2000s nostalgia through a noir filter: CRT scanlines over interrogation rooms, dialogue rendered in monospaced fonts on amber-tinted terminals, case files that look like they were printed on a dot matrix printer. Modern AI-driven narrative systems hidden behind interfaces that feel like using a police database from 2003. The technology is contemporary; the feeling is analog.

### Player's Emotional Arc

**Start of a run**: Disorientation. Who am I this time? What do I see? A slight unease — the familiar city seen through unfamiliar eyes.

**Mid-run**: Growing confidence. This version of me has a theory. The pieces fit. The combat clicks with this build. I know who did it.

**End of a run (success)**: A conclusion that feels earned — and then the quiet, creeping doubt. The meta-case board shows your conclusion contradicts a previous run's conclusion. Both felt right. Both can't be.

**End of a run (death)**: The fracture. The reshuffle. The strange grief of losing a version of yourself you were just starting to understand.

**Across runs**: A slow, accumulating vertigo. The realization that you are not converging on a single truth — you are building a portrait of a city through incompatible truths. The emotional destination is not certainty. It is *compassion for ambiguity*.

### The Story Hook

**Who killed Lena Hargate?**

She was found in the Whirling-in-Rags, a hotel that hasn't been a hotel in years. No witnesses. No motive that everyone agrees on. The case should be simple.

It isn't. Because every version of you who investigates finds a different killer. And every version is right. The real question isn't who killed Lena Hargate — it's *why the truth keeps changing*. That question is the thread that pulls the player across dozens of runs, toward a meta-revelation that reframes everything: the case, the city, and the detective themselves.

## THE MARKET

*[HYPE speaks]*

### Target Audience

**Primary**: Players aged 22-38 who love roguelites but crave narrative depth. They've put 200+ hours into Dead Cells or Hades and wished the story hit harder. They've played or admired Disco Elysium but want something they can play in 30-minute sessions. They hang out on r/roguelites, r/DiscoElysium, and r/patientgamers.

**Secondary**: Narrative game enthusiasts who usually avoid action games. The accessibility of the build-dependent difficulty (Empathy builds are inherently more forgiving) gives them an on-ramp.

**Tertiary**: Detective/mystery game fans looking for something with actual gameplay beyond "click the highlighted object." They play Return of the Obra Dinn, Her Story, and Paradise Killer.

### Comparable Games

1. **Dead Cells** meets **Disco Elysium**: The literal pitch. Dead Cells' tight, responsive 2D combat married to DE's psychological skill system.
2. **Hades** meets **Outer Wilds**: A roguelite where death isn't failure — it's information. Each run teaches you something about a larger mystery.
3. **Slay the Spire** meets **Blade Runner**: The strategic build diversity of a deck-builder, but instead of cards, you're building a psyche.
4. **Inscryption** meets **LA Noire**: A game that constantly recontextualizes what you thought you knew, wrapped in a detective framework.

### Unique Selling Proposition

There are roguelites with great combat. There are narrative games with great writing. There is exactly ONE game where your personality is your build, your build determines the truth, and the truth changes every run. Revachol Nights competes on a *new axis*: **the roguelite where the mystery is the meta-progression**.

### Platform Fit

**PC (Steam)**: Primary. This is where the roguelite audience lives. Steam's tagging system will surface this to Dead Cells, Hades, and Disco Elysium wishlists simultaneously.

**Nintendo Switch**: Secondary post-launch. Roguelites are the best-selling indie genre on Switch. The 20-40 minute run length is perfect for portable.

**PlayStation / Xbox**: Tertiary. Port after establishing a PC audience.

## THE SCOPE

### Feature Pillars (non-negotiable)

1. **The Psyche System**: 4 primary archetypes (Authority, Empathy, Logic, Electrochemistry) with 6 sub-skills each. Each archetype fundamentally changes combat verbs, movement feel, and available narrative paths.

2. **Tight 2D Combat**: Dead Cells-tier responsiveness. Frame-perfect dodge rolls. Weapon feel that changes with your psyche build.

3. **Case Refraction Narrative Engine**: The system that generates different case interpretations based on psyche builds. Modern AI hidden behind retro interfaces.

4. **Meta-Case Board**: The cross-run persistence layer. A conspiracy board that accumulates contradictory conclusions, witness statements, and evidence fragments.

5. **Internal Voices System**: The mid-combat psychological interruptions. Quick skill checks that break the flow just enough to remind you that you're a fractured mind in a trenchcoat.

### Stretch Goals (ordered by impact)

1. **Psyche Blending**: Allow players to "lock" one sub-skill between runs, creating intentional hybrid builds.
2. **Partner System**: Rotating cast of partner NPCs who accompany runs with their own psyche profiles.
3. **Revachol Radio**: Dynamic in-game radio that reacts to your psyche build and case progress.
4. **Rival Detective**: Procedurally generated rival solving the same case with a different psyche build.
5. **Dream Sequences**: Between-run hub sections set in the detective's subconscious.

### Cut List (NOT in v1)

- **Multiplayer / co-op**: The psyche system is fundamentally single-player.
- **Open-world exploration**: Roguelite structure demands curated layouts.
- **Voiced protagonist**: Would triple budget and halve narrative branching.
- **Crafting system**: There's already an economy (Insight).
- **Procedural generation of case content**: Case branches should be authored, not generated.

## Key Art / Mood Direction

**Hero image**: A detective silhouetted against rain-streaked glass, but instead of a reflection, the glass shows four different versions of them — one wreathed in red (Authority), one in blue (Empathy), one in gold (Logic), one in electric green (Electrochemistry). The city stretches behind them, neon signs bleeding through rain. Dark palette with selective neon — Drive (2011) meets Blade Runner meets a 2003 Windows XP desktop at 3 AM.

**UI mood**: CRT scanlines. Amber monochrome terminals for case files. Pixel-art character portraits. Diegetic HUD — the detective's internal monologue rendered as a retro OS interface.

**Audio mood**: Lo-fi noir jazz that shifts instrumentation based on dominant psyche. Authority: heavy brass and bass. Empathy: piano and cello. Logic: clean, minimal electronic. Electrochemistry: distorted, frenetic breakbeat.

## Open Questions and Next Steps

### Design Questions [REED]
- How many distinct combat archetypes can feel genuinely different before the animation budget breaks?
- What's the right Insight drop rate to maintain tension without starvation?
- Does the Internal Voices system interrupt flow or enhance it?
- Does the psyche reshuffle feel exciting or punishing?

### Narrative Questions [NOVA]
- How many authored case branches are needed before the system feels revelatory rather than repetitive?
- Where's the line between "different psychological interpretation" and "the game is just lying to me"?
- What's the detective's relationship to their own fragmentation?

### Marketing Questions [HYPE]
- When do we announce? The concept is strong enough for a reveal trailer built on the psyche-reshuffle moment.
- What's the demo scope? A single run with two psyche builds showing different outcomes.
- Do we lean into the Disco Elysium comparison or avoid it?

### Next Steps
1. Prototype the 30-second loop with two psyche archetypes.
2. Prototype Case Refraction with a single case node.
3. Build the Insight economy on paper.
4. Write the first case: Lena Hargate, four full branches.
5. Mood art and audio prototype.
6. Steam page goes live the moment the GIF exists.
