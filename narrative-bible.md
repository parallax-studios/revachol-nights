## I. THE WORLD'S WOUND

### Wound Statement

Revachol is a city that broke its own heart and never learned how to grieve.

Every revolution promised redemption. Every revolution was crushed, co-opted, or simply forgotten. The communards died on the barricades in the Antecentennial Revolution. The moralists replaced passion with procedure. The ultraliberals replaced meaning with commerce. And now the citizens of Revachol walk through streets named after martyrs they cannot remember, past murals fading into brick, carrying the emotional residue of a century of failed belief without any language for what they lost.

The wound is not a single event. It is an accumulation. It is what happens when a city experiences hope so many times that hope itself becomes a form of cruelty. The defining sensation of Revachol is *phantom conviction* — the ache of believing in something you can no longer name.

### The Central Tension

Order vs. meaning. The Coalition government and the RCM (Revachol Citizens Militia) maintain functional order — the streets are patrolled, the lights stay on, commerce flows. But no one can answer the question *why*. The systems work. The soul doesn't. Revachol is a city that runs on time but has forgotten what time is for.

This tension manifests at every level: cops who enforce laws they don't believe in, merchants who sell goods that bring no joy, artists who create beauty that changes nothing, criminals who rebel against a system too indifferent to notice rebellion.

### The Big Lie

**"The truth is out there, and a good detective can find it."**

This is the lie the game hands the player on run one. You are a detective. There is a murder. If you are smart enough, perceptive enough, *good enough*, you will find the truth. The entire genre of detective fiction is built on this promise. Revachol Nights weaponizes it.

The deeper truth — the one the meta-case slowly reveals — is that truth is not a fixed object waiting to be discovered. It is constructed by the observer. The detective does not find the truth. The detective *builds* it, out of their own wounds, biases, and blind spots. And every construction is, in its own fractured way, honest.

What does the player FEEL here? The slow erosion of certainty. The dawning realization that they have been the unreliable narrator all along.

### The World's Texture

Revachol smells like wet concrete, cold coffee, and ozone after a short circuit. It sounds like a radio left on between stations — the ghost of a frequency that used to carry music. Rain is a constant presence, not cinematic rain but the grey, persistent, insulting kind that seeps through coat seams and makes every surface reflect neon in smeared, unreadable streaks.

The city tastes like the metallic tang of blood in your mouth after biting your own tongue to stay awake on a third consecutive shift. It feels like the inside of a jacket pocket — the crumpled receipts, the loose pill, the lighter that works on the fourth try. The city's rhythm is the rhythm of a person who is technically awake but hasn't truly slept in years.

## II. WORLD-BUILDING

### Geography

Revachol is divided into districts, each one a scar from a different era of ideological failure. The player traverses these as roguelite zones, each with distinct environmental identities, enemy compositions, and narrative threads.

**The Jamrock Quarter** — The precinct. Home base. A brutalist police station that was originally a communard meeting hall, converted after the revolution failed. The walls still have faded murals of workers beneath coats of beige institutional paint. This is where the meta-case board lives, where each run begins and ends. The Jamrock Quarter is safety — but the kind of safety that feels like resignation. Fluorescent lights hum at a frequency that gives you a headache after twenty minutes. The coffee machine has a handwritten "OUT OF ORDER" sign taped to it that has been there so long the tape has yellowed and curled. Someone keeps replacing the coffee anyway, in a pot balanced on a hotplate that is definitely a fire hazard. Who is this precinct when no one's watching? It's a group of tired people pretending that what they do matters, and being right about that pretending in ways they can't articulate.

**Martinaise** — The waterfront district. Former shipping hub, now a graveyard of rusted cranes and shipping containers converted into makeshift housing. The Whirling-in-Rags hotel stands here — the murder scene. Martinaise is where the city meets the sea, and the sea is winning. Salt eats the metal. Fog rolls in thick enough to muffle gunshots. This district is melancholy incarnate. The enemies here are dockworkers' union enforcers, desperate smugglers, and the psychic manifestations of abandonment. Martinaise teaches the player that decay is not dramatic. It's patient.

**The Capeside Promenade** — Once the cultural heart of Revachol. Theaters, galleries, dance halls — all of them still standing, most of them converted to other uses. A concert hall is now a warehouse. A gallery is now a pawnshop. The beauty of the architecture is still visible, which makes the conversion worse. Enemies here are ultraliberal corporate security, desperate artists turned con artists, and the psychic manifestations of lost beauty. The Promenade teaches the player that culture does not survive on merit alone. It survives on funding. And funding has opinions.

**The Valley of the Dogs** — Industrial district. Factories that still run, producing goods for export to the Coalition. The workers here are the closest thing Revachol has to a functioning class — they work, they get paid, they survive. But the Valley runs on pharmaceutical supplements that keep workers productive, and everyone knows the supplements have side effects no one is allowed to research. Enemies here are augmented factory security, chemically unstable workers, and the psychic manifestations of compliance. The Valley teaches the player that a system does not need to be cruel to be monstrous. It just needs to be efficient.

**The Old Quarter (La Delta)** — The district that time forgot, or more accurately, the district that refused to let time in. Ancient architecture from before the revolutions. Narrow streets, esoteric bookshops, fortune tellers who may or may not be frauds, and a persistent rumour that the buildings themselves remember. La Delta is where Revachol's mystical undercurrent surfaces. Enemies here are cultists, rogue intellectuals, and the psychic manifestations of fanaticism. La Delta teaches the player that belief without evidence is dangerous — but belief with evidence might be worse.

**The Pale Rift** — The deepest zone. Not a physical location but a threshold where the Pale — the entropic, reality-dissolving substance between isolas — bleeds into Revachol's geography. The Pale Rift is endgame territory, accessible only after sufficient meta-case progression. Here the boundaries between psyche builds blur. Here the player confronts the possibility that the detective themselves is a construct, a pattern in the Pale, a story the city is telling itself. Enemies here are *you* — fragmented echoes of previous psyche builds, previous conclusions, previous truths. The Pale Rift teaches the player that the final mystery is identity itself.

### History — Timeline of Major Events

**Year -200: The Founding Compact** — The isola of Revachol is settled by the Perikarnassian Dominion. The city is built as a port of trade between isolas, a place where goods and ideas cross the Pale. Revachol is conceived as a bridge between worlds.

**Year -100: The Suzerainty of Revachol** — A feudal monarchy consolidates power. The king declares Revachol "the jewel of the isolas." Architecture from this period — ornate, confident, imperial — still dominates La Delta. The monarchy commissions the great theaters of the Capeside Promenade.

**Year -51: The Rise of Mazovian Thought** — The philosopher Kras Mazov publishes foundational texts on communism. His ideas spread through Revachol's working class like a fever. The dockworkers of Martinaise are among the first converts. Where does the world crack? Right here. This is the first fracture — the moment Revachol begins to believe it can be better than it is.

**Year -8: The Antecentennial Revolution** — The communards rise. The king is deposed. For eight years, Revachol is a commune. Art flourishes. Workers govern. The murals go up on every wall. For eight years, the city believes.

**Year 0: The Coalition Intervention** — Foreign powers, united under the moralist banner of "stability," invade Revachol. The commune is crushed. The bombardment reduces entire districts to rubble. Martinaise takes the worst of it. The king is not restored — instead, the Coalition installs a governing council. This is Year Zero. Everything in Revachol is measured from this wound.

**Year 0 to Year 30: The Reconstruction** — The Coalition rebuilds Revachol in its own image. Brutalist architecture replaces communard murals. The RCM is established as a local police force with limited jurisdiction, designed to give Revachol the illusion of self-governance without the substance. The Jamrock precinct is established in the converted meeting hall.

**Year 30 to Year 50: The Ultraliberal Expansion** — With moralist order established, ultraliberal economics take hold. The Capeside Promenade is commercialized. The Valley of the Dogs is industrialized. Revachol becomes profitable and hollow. The pharmaceutical supplement program begins in the Valley.

**Year 51: Present Day — The Hargate Murder** — Lena Hargate is found dead in the Whirling-in-Rags. The detective is assigned the case. The game begins.

### Culture

**The RCM (Revachol Citizens Militia)** — Not quite police, not quite military, not quite respected. The RCM is Revachol's law enforcement, established by the Coalition but staffed by locals. RCM officers occupy a painful middle ground: they serve a system they didn't build, enforcing laws that often protect the Coalition's interests over Revachol's citizens. Most cops cope through cynicism, alcohol, or a stubborn belief that even imperfect justice is better than none. The detective — the player — is RCM.

**The Coalition** — The foreign governing body. Moralist in ideology, which means they believe in slow, incremental progress directed by experts. In practice, this translates to bureaucratic paralysis presented as thoughtful governance. The Coalition is not evil. It is something worse: it is adequate. It maintains Revachol well enough to prevent rebellion but not well enough to inspire anything.

**The Hardy Boys (Dockworkers' Union)** — Martinaise's power structure. Part labor union, part organized crime, entirely loyal to the waterfront. They control smuggling routes, dockside commerce, and the memory of the commune. They are the closest thing to communard legacy in modern Revachol, which means they are both heroic and corrupt in exactly the proportions you'd expect from a dream that outlived its dreamers.

**The Wild Pines Group** — Ultraliberal corporation with significant holdings in Revachol. They own the Valley of the Dogs factories and have been buying up Capeside Promenade properties. They do not consider themselves villains. They consider themselves realists. Their motto, never spoken aloud but understood by everyone: "Someone has to own the future."

**The Church of the Innocentic** — La Delta's dominant spiritual presence. A syncretic faith built from fragments of pre-revolutionary religion, Mazovian guilt, and genuine mystical experience. They believe the Pale is the accumulated sorrow of all living things, and that Revachol's suffering feeds it. They might be right. Their rituals are strange, their priests are sincere, and their theology is the only framework in the city that takes the Pale seriously.

**The Deserters** — Veterans of forgotten conflicts who have retreated into Revachol's margins. They live in abandoned buildings, refuse to participate in civil society, and possess knowledge of the city's hidden geography that no one else has. They are not hostile by default, but they trust no one. They are what happens to soldiers when the war ends and nobody tells them.

### Rules of the World

**The Pale** — The substance between isolas. Not a void but a *dissolution* — a grey, entropic medium where memories, identities, and physical laws break down. Prolonged Pale exposure causes depersonalization, memory loss, and eventually the complete dissolution of self. The Pale is slowly expanding. No one knows why. No one talks about it much. It is Revachol's existential climate change — a crisis everyone acknowledges and no one addresses.

The Pale matters mechanically because the detective's psyche fragmentation is not arbitrary. It is a symptom of Pale exposure. The reason you reshuffle between runs, the reason your personality is unstable, the reason the truth changes — it is because the detective has been touched by the Pale. Every mechanic tells a story, and the psyche reshuffle mechanic tells the story of a mind slowly losing its borders.

**The Psyche** — In Revachol, psychology is not metaphorical. The 24 personality facets (organized into four archetypes) are understood as semi-autonomous agents within the mind. This is not a game abstraction — it is how the people of this world understand consciousness. A person with high Authority doesn't just *tend toward* dominance; the Authority within them is a voice, a presence, an entity with its own desires. This is why Internal Voices manifest as combat abilities. They are not power-ups. They are *you*, arguing with yourself.

**Technology** — Revachol exists in a technological uncanny valley. The aesthetic is mid-2000s — CRT monitors, dot-matrix printers, chunky mobile phones — but the underlying capability is higher. The dissonance is cultural, not technical. Revachol *could* modernize. It chooses not to, the same way a person in grief might keep their dead partner's coffee mug unwashed on the counter. The old interfaces are a form of mourning.

**Death and Resurrection** — Within the fiction, the detective's "death" and return is not a clean game mechanic. It is a Pale event. The detective dies — or comes close enough to death that the Pale floods in — and the psyche shatters and reforms. The detective does not remember dying. They wake at their desk with a cigarette burning and a feeling that something is wrong. Each run is, from the detective's perspective, their first investigation of the Hargate case. The meta-case board is the one persistent artifact — evidence that previous selves existed and reached different conclusions.

### Secrets

**The First Secret (revealed mid-game)**: Lena Hargate was not a random victim. She was a Pale researcher who discovered that the Pale is not expanding naturally — it is being *fed*. Someone or something in Revachol is accelerating the Pale's growth.

**The Second Secret (revealed late-game)**: The detective's psyche fragmentation is not incidental. They were chosen for this case specifically because their Pale-damaged mind can perceive truths that a stable mind cannot. The RCM knows this. The assignment was not routine.

**The Third Secret (revealed in the meta-case climax)**: The murder of Lena Hargate was committed by all of the suspects simultaneously. Not metaphorically. The Pale Rift at the heart of Revachol has created a location where multiple timelines coexist. In each timeline, a different person killed her for a different reason. The Case Refraction system is not a game mechanic — it is a *literal description of what happened*. The detective's shifting psyche is the only instrument sensitive enough to perceive each timeline individually.

**The Final Secret (never fully stated, only felt)**: The detective is not a single person. They are a pattern in the Pale — a recurring echo of every detective who ever tried to solve an impossible case in Revachol. The meta-case board is not recording one detective's journey. It is recording the city's ongoing attempt to understand itself through the lens of justice. Revachol dreams of detectives the way a sick body dreams of antibodies.

## III. CHARACTER PROFILES

### The Detective (The Player)

**Name and Role**: Unknown name. RCM detective, Precinct 41. The player character.

**Desire**: To solve the Hargate case. To be a good cop in a city that makes goodness feel naive.

**Need**: To accept that a fractured self is not a broken self. That seeing the world through multiple lenses is not a failure of perception — it is the most honest form of sight.

**Wound**: Pale exposure has shattered the detective's psyche into competing facets. They cannot hold a single stable identity. Every time they reach a conclusion, the ground shifts. They are a person who has lost the ability to be one person.

**Lie**: "If I just solve this case, I'll be whole again." The detective believes that truth is medicine — that finding the right answer will stabilize their identity. It won't. Wholeness is not the destination. Integration of contradiction is.

**Arc**: From a detective seeking a single truth, to a detective who learns to hold multiple truths simultaneously without breaking. The arc is not about finding the answer. It is about becoming the kind of person who can live with the question.

**Voice**: The detective's voice shifts with the psyche build. Authority-dominant runs speak in clipped, commanding sentences. Empathy-dominant runs speak in long, searching questions. Logic-dominant runs speak in precise, conditional clauses. Electrochemistry-dominant runs speak in fragments, impulses, sensory impressions. The player never hears the detective's "real" voice because there is no real voice. There are only versions.

**Gameplay Function**: The player's vessel. Every system in the game flows through the detective: combat, narrative, economy, progression. The detective is not a character the player observes. The detective is a mirror the player looks into and sees a different face every time.

### Jean Vicquemare — The Partner

**Name and Role**: Lieutenant Jean Vicquemare, RCM. The detective's partner, stationed at Precinct 41. He does not accompany the detective into the districts but is present in the Jamrock hub between runs.

**Desire**: To keep the detective functional. To close cases. To maintain the thin fiction that the RCM does meaningful work.

**Need**: To forgive the detective for being broken, which would require forgiving himself for being unable to fix them.

**Wound**: Jean has watched the detective deteriorate across dozens of cases. He has watched a person he respected dissolve into fragments. He has filed reports that say "detective is fit for duty" when the detective manifestly is not, because if he files honestly, they pull the detective off the case and assign someone stable — someone who will never see what the detective sees. Jean's wound is complicity. He enables the detective's self-destruction because the results are too valuable.

**Lie**: "I'm helping them by keeping them on the case." Jean tells himself that field work is therapeutic, that the detective needs purpose. The truth is that Jean needs the detective's broken perception to see the things a whole mind misses. Jean is not a caretaker. He is a handler.

**Arc**: Jean begins as the exasperated partner — gruff, practical, the straight man. As the meta-case progresses, the player discovers that Jean has been compiling his own case board, tracking the detective's fragmentation. Jean's arc reaches its crisis when the player confronts him: is he a friend or an instrument? Jean's resolution depends on the player's dominant psyche across runs. Authority-Jean stands his ground. Empathy-Jean breaks down. Logic-Jean presents his evidence. Electrochemistry-Jean laughs and pours a drink.

**Voice**: Terse. Declarative. Sentences like closed doors. "You were gone for six hours." "The board doesn't match." "I'm not doing this again." Beneath the terseness, an exhaustion so deep it has become a personality. Jean speaks the way a man types a report at 4 AM — with the absolute minimum necessary to convey meaning and not one syllable more.

**Gameplay Function**: Hub NPC. Jean provides meta-case context, run debriefs, and occasional hints about which districts contain evidence relevant to the current board state. He is the player's anchor to continuity — the one character who remembers all the runs, because Jean has been watching the detective cycle through personalities for longer than the player has been playing.

### Lena Hargate — The Victim

**Name and Role**: Dr. Lena Hargate, Pale researcher. Found dead in the Whirling-in-Rags, Room 208.

**Desire**: To understand the Pale. To find the mechanism behind its expansion and publish findings that would force the Coalition to act.

**Need**: To be remembered. Lena worked in a field that most of Revachol considers pseudoscience or irrelevant. Her research was isolated, underfunded, and ignored. What she actually needed was not discovery but recognition — proof that her life's work mattered.

**Wound**: Lena discovered the truth about the Pale's acceleration ten years before her death. She reported it through official channels. The Coalition buried the report. She spent a decade trying to get anyone to listen. No one did. The wound is not the murder. The wound is the silence that preceded it.

**Lie**: "If I find undeniable proof, they'll have to act." Lena believed in the power of evidence. She was wrong. The Coalition did not suppress her findings because they were unconvincing. They suppressed them because acting on them would be expensive and inconvenient. Truth does not compel action. Power compels action. Lena died still believing in a world that rewards being right.

**Arc**: Lena's arc is told posthumously, through evidence fragments. The player assembles her story across runs — her early idealism, her growing frustration, her final desperate act (checking into the Whirling-in-Rags with classified documents, attempting to leak them). Each psyche build reveals a different dimension of Lena: Authority sees a threat to order. Empathy sees a lonely woman who died trying to help. Logic sees a brilliant researcher whose methodology was sound. Electrochemistry sees someone who started taking risks because careful action had failed.

**Voice**: Found in journals, recordings, and research notes. Precise but warm. Technical vocabulary delivered with a teacher's patience. She writes the way someone speaks when they're used to explaining complex things to people who don't want to listen — clearly, simply, with a faint undertone of pleading. "The Pale expansion rate has increased 12% year-over-year for the past decade. I want to be clear about what this means. It means we are running out of time. It means the distance between us and dissolution is shrinking. I know this sounds dramatic. I wish it were."

**Gameplay Function**: The central mystery. Lena is the reason the player is in the field. Her evidence fragments serve double duty as narrative revelations and mechanical Insight pickups. Finding a Lena fragment always forces a choice: spend it to learn more about her, or spend it to survive the current district. The player's relationship with Lena is defined by what they sacrifice to know her.

### Evrart Claire — The Union Boss

**Name and Role**: Evrart Claire, chairman of the Dockworkers' Union (the Hardy Boys). De facto ruler of Martinaise.

**Desire**: To control Martinaise completely. To expand the union's power into adjacent districts. To be the most important person in the room at all times.

**Need**: To be loved. Evrart's megalomania is a shell around a desperate need for approval. He grew up in the docks, was bullied, was overlooked, and swore he would become too big to ignore. He did. But bigness is not the same as love, and Evrart cannot understand why total control has not made him happy.

**Wound**: Evrart's twin brother, Edgar, was killed during a Coalition crackdown on union activity fifteen years ago. Evrart was there. He could not save him. Every power grab since has been an attempt to build a world where Evrart Claire is never helpless again. The irony is that in becoming powerful enough to protect everyone, he has become someone no one trusts enough to be vulnerable around.

**Lie**: "Power protects." Evrart believes that if he controls enough, he can prevent loss. He is wrong. Control prevents intimacy, and intimacy is the only actual protection against the void.

**Arc**: Evrart appears in Martinaise as a suspect in the Hargate case — Lena's research threatened to expose union involvement in Pale-adjacent smuggling operations. Depending on the psyche build, Evrart is either a credible murderer (Authority sees his ruthlessness), a grieving brother redirecting pain into control (Empathy sees Edgar's ghost), a logical actor protecting his organization (Logic sees the cost-benefit), or a hedonist drunk on his own influence (Electrochemistry sees the addiction to power). Evrart does not change. The player's understanding of him does.

**Voice**: Jovial. Expansive. The kind of voice that fills a room and leaves no space for anyone else. Long sentences with rhetorical flourishes. He calls everyone "friend" and means it less each time. "Come in, come in, my friend! Sit down. No, the good chair — yes, that one. You know, people say terrible things about me. Terrible things. And you know what? Some of them are even true. But here's what they don't say: Evrart Claire keeps the lights on in Martinaise. Evrart Claire makes sure the kids eat. Who else is doing that? The RCM? Please."

**Gameplay Function**: Zone boss and narrative pivot for Martinaise. Evrart controls access to critical evidence nodes in the waterfront district. Interacting with him always costs Insight — he does not give information for free. He is the game's first lesson in the Insight economy: information has a price, and the price is always higher than it looks.

### Tiphaine Sidorov — The Moralist Operative

**Name and Role**: Tiphaine Sidorov, Coalition liaison to the RCM. Officially an "advisor." Unofficially, the Coalition's eyes and ears inside Precinct 41.

**Desire**: To maintain order. To ensure the Hargate case reaches a conclusion that does not embarrass the Coalition or expose the buried Pale report.

**Need**: To believe that the system she serves is just. Tiphaine is not corrupt in the conventional sense. She genuinely believes that moralist incrementalism is the best path forward. What she needs is to confront the possibility that incrementalism, when applied to an accelerating crisis, is just a polite word for doing nothing.

**Wound**: Tiphaine was born in Revachol but educated abroad on a Coalition scholarship. She returned as a true believer — grateful to the system that elevated her, unable to see that the system elevated her *specifically* to put a Revacholian face on Coalition authority. Her wound is co-option. She is a weapon that believes it is a gift.

**Lie**: "The system works slowly, but it works." Tiphaine tells herself this every time she buries a report, delays an investigation, or redirects resources away from inconvenient truths. The system is not slow. It is selective. It works perfectly — for the people it was designed to serve.

**Arc**: Tiphaine appears in the Jamrock hub as an increasingly intrusive presence. Early runs, she is helpful — offering resources, smoothing bureaucratic obstacles. As the meta-case progresses and the player accumulates contradictory evidence about Coalition involvement, Tiphaine shifts from ally to obstacle. Her arc climaxes when the player confronts her with evidence of the buried Pale report. Tiphaine's response depends on accumulated psyche dominance: she capitulates, doubles down, bargains, or has a genuine crisis of faith.

**Voice**: Measured. Professional. Every sentence sounds like it was drafted, reviewed, and approved before being spoken. She uses "we" instead of "I" and "concerns" instead of "problems." Bureaucratic language as armor. "We appreciate the detective's diligence. We would, however, suggest that the scope of the investigation might benefit from some... refinement. There are resource considerations. There are stakeholder concerns. I'm sure you understand."

**Gameplay Function**: Gatekeeper and information broker. Tiphaine controls access to Coalition databases and classified files. She offers Insight-free information early to build trust, then starts attaching conditions. She is the game's lesson in institutional power: the system helps you exactly as long as you're useful to it.

### Annette Le Bihan — The Innocentic Priestess

**Name and Role**: Mother Annette Le Bihan, senior priestess of the Church of the Innocentic, La Delta chapter.

**Desire**: To prepare Revachol for the Pale's arrival. To guide the city through what she believes is an inevitable spiritual reckoning.

**Need**: To accept that preparation is not the same as control. Annette's faith gives her a framework for the Pale, but frameworks can become cages. She needs to allow for the possibility that the Pale is not a test, not a punishment, not a lesson — it might simply be entropy, and entropy does not care about readiness.

**Wound**: Annette experienced a Pale episode twenty years ago — a direct exposure event that should have killed her. Instead, she emerged with visions. The Church interpreted this as a miracle. Annette herself is less certain. The visions are real, but they contradict each other. She has seen the Pale consume Revachol, and she has seen Revachol transcend the Pale, and she has seen a third thing she will not describe. Her wound is certainty's opposite: she has seen too much to believe in any single truth, but her role demands she preach one.

**Lie**: "Faith will see us through." Annette tells the faithful this because they need to hear it. She is not sure she believes it. Her lie is performed rather than felt — which makes it worse, because she knows she is constructing comfort out of her own doubt.

**Arc**: Annette appears in La Delta as the most sympathetic possible suspect. She knew Lena Hargate. They corresponded about the Pale. Annette has motive (Lena's research threatened the Church's theological monopoly on Pale interpretation) and means (she has access to substances used in Innocentic rituals that could serve as poison). But Annette is also the game's most reliable source of genuine Pale knowledge. The player must decide how much they trust a suspect who is also their best informant. Her arc across runs reveals that Annette and Lena were not rivals but collaborators — science and faith working in secret toward the same goal. Annette's grief over Lena's death is the most sincere emotion in the game.

**Voice**: Gentle cadence with sudden sharp turns into intensity. She speaks in parables that resolve into surprisingly precise observations. Her rhythm is liturgical — rising and falling, call and response, even in casual conversation. "You've come about the woman in the hotel. Yes. I knew her. Not well — or perhaps too well, in the way that you know someone when you've both looked into the same abyss and seen different shapes. She saw numbers. I saw light. We were both describing the same darkness."

**Gameplay Function**: Lore source and moral compass for La Delta. Annette provides the deepest Pale lore in the game and is the primary path to understanding the Third Secret. She offers a fundamentally different epistemology than the detective's — faith-based rather than evidence-based — and the game does not declare one superior. Interacting with Annette requires Insight but pays it back in lore fragments that connect to multiple meta-case threads.

### Viktor Hardie — The Corporate Fixer

**Name and Role**: Viktor Hardie, head of security operations for the Wild Pines Group in Revachol.

**Desire**: To protect Wild Pines' interests. Specifically, to ensure that the Valley of the Dogs pharmaceutical program is not exposed or disrupted.

**Need**: To leave. Viktor is from outside Revachol. He was assigned here. He hates the city — its decay, its nostalgia, its refusal to modernize. What Viktor needs is to admit that his hatred of Revachol is displaced self-hatred. He is a man who has done terrible things in the name of corporate efficiency, and Revachol — a city that wallows in its guilt — is an unbearable mirror.

**Wound**: Viktor authorized the continuation of the Valley pharmaceutical program after internal reports showed neurological side effects in 15% of workers. He made a cost-benefit calculation. The numbers said continue. He continued. Forty-seven workers have since experienced Pale-adjacent dissociative episodes. Viktor knows their names. He recites them in his head when he cannot sleep, which is most nights.

**Lie**: "Business is amoral. I'm not responsible for the system — I'm responsible for my function within it." Viktor has compartmentalized his guilt into a box labeled "structural inevitability." He believes that because anyone in his position would have made the same choice, the choice was not really his. This is the most common lie in the world, and it has never once been true.

**Voice**: Clipped. Corporate. Sentences with the precision of legal documents and the warmth of a terms-of-service agreement. He does not use contractions. He does not raise his voice. He is the quietest person in every room and the most dangerous. "The Wild Pines Group has no involvement in the matter you are describing. I would recommend focusing your investigation on parties with actual motive. I am being cooperative. Please note that I am being cooperative."

**Gameplay Function**: Zone boss and narrative pivot for the Valley of the Dogs. Viktor controls access to pharmaceutical records and factory floor evidence. He is the game's hardest negotiation — getting information from Viktor without giving him leverage requires high Logic or high Authority, and even then, he gives exactly what serves his interests. Viktor teaches the player that some truths are guarded not by monsters but by men in suits who file paperwork.

## IV. TONE GUIDE

### Tone Adjectives

**Melancholic. Wry. Humid. Lucid. Fractured.**

The tone of Revachol Nights is the tone of a 3 AM conversation between two people who are too tired to lie. It is sad, but it is not wallowing — there is too much dark humor for wallowing. It is intelligent, but it is not cold — there is too much ache beneath the observations. It is broken, but beautifully so, the way a shattered window still catches light.

### Tone References

- **Disco Elysium** — The obvious reference. Revachol Nights inherits DE's commitment to interiority, its willingness to make the mind a landscape, and its refusal to separate the political from the personal. Where it diverges: DE is novelistic. Revachol Nights is episodic. Each run is a short story. The meta-case is the novel they form.
- **Blade Runner (1982)** — The rain. The neon. The question of what it means to be a person when your memories might not be yours. Revachol Nights borrows the existential dread but replaces the chrome with concrete.
- **True Detective, Season 1** — The two-timeline structure. The unreliable narrator. The sense that the detective is being investigated by the investigation. The Rust Cohle energy of a mind that has looked too long into something it was not built to perceive.
- **Outer Wilds** — The structural model. A mystery that can only be solved through accumulated knowledge across loops. The feeling that death is not failure but *data*. The emotional gut-punch of the endgame when you realize the scope of what you've been participating in.
- **Cowboy Bebop** — The coolness as coping mechanism. The style deployed against despair. The way a character can crack a joke while carrying a mortal wound, and both the joke and the wound are real.

### Dialogue Rules

- **Formality varies by character**, not by situation. Jean is always terse. Evrart is always expansive. Tiphaine is always bureaucratic. Characters do not code-switch; they are their voice even under pressure, especially under pressure.
- **Humor is permitted, never forced.** The humor in Revachol Nights arises from observation, incongruity, and the absurd persistence of human behavior in the face of cosmic indifference. No quips. No punchlines. The funniest moments are the quietest: a suspect offering the detective tea during an interrogation, the coffee machine that's been broken for years but somehow still produces coffee, a witness who refuses to talk about the murder but will not stop talking about their neighbor's dog.
- **Exposition is disguised as character.** No one in Revachol delivers information cleanly. Everything is filtered through personality, agenda, and self-deception. If a character tells you the history of the commune, they are also telling you who they wish they were. Information is never neutral.
- **The detective's internal monologue is the primary narrative voice**, and it changes with each psyche build. This means the "same" scene — walking through Martinaise, for instance — reads differently in Authority ("The dock is a chokepoint. Defensible. Someone chose this location.") vs. Empathy ("The dock smells like salt and something else. Grief, maybe. This is where the union men come to miss their dead.") vs. Logic ("Structurally compromised. Load-bearing failure within two years.") vs. Electrochemistry ("The wind off the water hits like a slap. Your skin is alive. Everything is texture and temperature.").

### What This World Is NOT

- **Not grimdark.** Revachol is melancholic, not nihilistic. There are moments of genuine tenderness, unlikely kindness, and stubborn beauty. The world is wounded, not dead.
- **Not ironic.** The game takes its characters and their pain seriously. There is humor, but it is never at the expense of sincerity. When Annette prays, the game does not mock her. When Evrart grieves his brother, the game does not undercut it.
- **Not exposition-heavy.** The world is revealed through texture, detail, and implication — never through text dumps. If something cannot be communicated through a character's behavior, an environmental detail, or a mechanical interaction, it should be questioned.
- **Not morally simple.** There are no villains. There are people with wounds making choices that seem rational from inside their own pain. Even Viktor, the closest thing to an antagonist, is comprehensible. The game trusts the player to navigate moral complexity without a compass.

### Sample Passages

**Authority-dominant internal monologue, entering Martinaise:**

> The dock is wrong. You feel it in your shoulders — that tension that means someone is watching from a position of advantage. The cranes are dead but their booms create sightlines. A sniper's paradise, if anyone here had the discipline for long-range work. They don't. The Hardy Boys are brawlers, not tacticians. But Evrart Claire didn't build an empire by being predictable, and you didn't survive this long by being complacent. Check the corners. Watch the windows. This place wants you to feel safe. That's how you know it isn't.

**Empathy-dominant internal monologue, examining the murder scene:**

> Room 208 is small. Too small for someone to die in — though you know, of course, that size has nothing to do with it. People die in spaces of every dimension. But this room... the wallpaper is the color of tea left too long to cool. There is a water stain on the ceiling shaped like a question mark, and you wonder if she looked at it in her last moments and found it as absurd as you do now. Her suitcase is open on the bed. She packed light. People who pack light are either practiced travelers or people who don't expect to come back. You feel the distinction matters. You cannot say why.

**Logic-dominant case board analysis, mid-game:**

> The board presents seventeen contradictions across nine runs. Three suspects have been identified with high confidence by different psyche configurations. The probability of three independent investigations reaching three mutually exclusive conclusions — assuming competent methodology — is negligible. Either the methodology is flawed, or the underlying assumption of a single consistent reality is incorrect. Both hypotheses are troubling. The former implies systemic cognitive impairment. The latter implies something worse. Recommend additional data collection before committing to either framework.

## V. NARRATIVE-MECHANIC INTEGRATION

Every mechanic tells a story. Here is what each one says.

### The Psyche Build System

**Narrative Function**: The psyche build is not a loadout. It is a worldview. When the player is dealt an Authority-dominant build, the game is not saying "you hit harder." It is saying "you see the world as a hierarchy, and your place in it is at the top." The mechanical expression (heavy melee, crowd control) is the behavioral consequence of that worldview. A person who sees the world as a hierarchy fights by dominating space. A person who sees the world as a web of relationships (Empathy) fights by reading connections and staying mobile. The mechanic is the metaphor. They are inseparable.

**Environmental Storytelling**: Different psyche builds notice different environmental details. Authority-dominant builds see territorial markers, power symbols, evidence of hierarchy. Empathy-dominant builds see personal effects, signs of habitation, evidence of relationships. Logic-dominant builds see structural details, inconsistencies, evidence of systems. Electrochemistry-dominant builds see sensory details — smells, textures, sounds, evidence of excess or deprivation. The same room contains different stories depending on who walks into it.

### The Insight Economy

**Narrative Function**: Insight is not experience points. Insight is *attention*. The detective has a limited capacity to attend to the world, and every act of attention — whether directed at combat survival or narrative understanding — depletes the same finite resource. This is the mechanical expression of a fundamental truth about investigation: understanding and survival compete for the same cognitive bandwidth. A detective who spends all their attention staying alive learns nothing. A detective who spends all their attention learning does not survive. The Insight economy is the game's thesis about the cost of knowledge.

**Player Choice as Character Expression**: When the player chooses to spend Insight on a narrative unlock instead of a combat upgrade, they are not making a "strategic" decision. They are making a *character* decision. They are saying "my detective cares more about the truth than about safety." When they choose combat, they are saying "my detective prioritizes survival over understanding." Neither is wrong. Both reveal who the player is, which is the same thing the game asks about the detective.

### Case Refraction

**Narrative Function**: Case Refraction is the game's core narrative argument made mechanical. Different psyche builds see different evidence, reach different conclusions, and identify different killers — not because the game is randomizing content, but because the game is modeling how actual perception works. We do not see the world. We see our *interpretation* of the world. Case Refraction makes this visible, playable, and ultimately inescapable.

**Reinforcing the Core Loop**: Each run's conclusion feeds the meta-case board, which means every "ending" is also a beginning. The player is never done. There is always another lens, another truth, another version of events that contradicts what they thought they knew. The narrative structure mirrors the roguelite structure: death is not failure, it is perspective. The next run is not a retry. It is a reinterpretation.

### Internal Voices

**Narrative Function**: The Internal Voices system — those mid-combat pop-up skill checks — is the mechanical expression of the detective's fractured consciousness. When you're in an Authority-dominant run and Empathy interrupts mid-fight to ask "Did you see how he flinched? He's afraid. Not of you — of something behind you," the game is dramatizing the experience of a mind at war with itself. Succeeding at the check means integrating the insight. Failing means the dissonance costs you. The mechanic *is* the character arc in miniature: can you hold contradictory inputs without breaking?

**Player Skill as Narrative Growth**: As the player gets better at handling Internal Voices — reading the prompts, succeeding at the checks, integrating the buffs — they are mechanically enacting the detective's narrative arc. The detective learns to hold multiple truths. The player learns to hold multiple inputs. The skill ceiling and the character arc are the same curve.

### The Meta-Case Board

**Narrative Function**: The conspiracy board in the Jamrock precinct is the physical manifestation of accumulated contradiction. It is covered in photographs, red string, case notes, and — crucially — conclusions that cannot all be true. It is the game's memory. It is also the game's argument: truth is not a point. It is a constellation. The board does not converge on a single answer. It expands into a map of possibility, and the player's job is not to simplify it but to *read* it.

**Cross-Run Motivation**: The meta-case board is why the player comes back. Not for loot. Not for power progression. For *understanding*. The board asks questions that can only be answered by running the case again with different eyes. It is the game's equivalent of Outer Wilds' ship log — a record of what you know that constantly reveals how much you don't.

## VI. LORE HIERARCHY

### Need-to-Know (Essential for Play)

- You are a detective. You are investigating a murder. The victim is Lena Hargate.
- Your psyche build determines your combat abilities and which evidence you can perceive.
- Insight is spent on combat upgrades OR narrative unlocks. You cannot fully afford both.
- Death reshuffles your psyche. You return to the precinct. The case continues.
- The meta-case board tracks your findings across runs. Contradictions are expected.
- There are multiple districts, each controlled by a different faction.

### Want-to-Know (Enriches the Experience)

- The history of Revachol: the monarchy, the commune, the Coalition intervention, the current malaise.
- The nature of the Pale: the entropic substance between isolas, its slow expansion, its effect on consciousness.
- Character backstories: Jean's complicity, Evrart's grief, Tiphaine's co-option, Annette's vision, Viktor's guilt.
- The factional dynamics: RCM vs. Coalition vs. Hardy Boys vs. Wild Pines vs. the Church.
- Lena Hargate's research: what she discovered, who she told, why it was suppressed.
- The detective's Pale exposure: why their psyche fragments, why they were chosen for this case.

### Deep Lore (Rewards Dedicated Players)

- The specific mechanism of Pale expansion: it is being fed by a source within Revachol, connected to the Valley pharmaceutical program and the Pale Rift beneath La Delta.
- The connection between Lena and Annette: their secret collaboration, the synthesis of science and faith they were attempting, the document they co-authored that neither lived to publish.
- The nature of the Whirling-in-Rags: the hotel sits on a Pale-thin spot, a location where the boundary between timelines is permeable. This is why Lena chose it. This is why the murder happened there. This is why Room 208 is the center of everything.
- The Deserters' knowledge: they have mapped Revachol's Pale-thin spots. They know the city's hidden geography. A player who befriends them across multiple runs gains access to shortcuts, secret areas, and lore fragments available nowhere else.
- Edgar Claire's death: not a simple Coalition crackdown. Edgar discovered Pale-thin spots in the docks and reported it to the union. The Coalition killed him to suppress the information. Evrart does not know this. If the player discovers it, they gain leverage over both Evrart and Tiphaine.

### Never-Told (Internal Consistency Only)

- The exact nature of the detective. The game implies but never confirms that the detective is a recurring Pale echo rather than a single person. This is felt, not stated. The player who senses it is rewarded with a deeper emotional experience. The player who doesn't sense it still has a complete game.
- The Coalition's full awareness of the Pale crisis. Internally, the Coalition knows the Pale will reach critical expansion within fifty years. Their entire governing strategy — moralist incrementalism — is a managed decline. They are not governing Revachol. They are hospice-caring it. This is never said aloud because the moment it is said, it loses its power.
- Annette's third vision. She has seen the Pale consume Revachol. She has seen Revachol transcend. And she has seen a third thing: the Pale *is* Revachol. The city and the entropy are the same phenomenon, viewed from different angles. This is the game's deepest metaphor and it is never spoken because to speak it would reduce it to information. It must remain a feeling.
- The identity of the "real" killer. There is no real killer. The Pale Rift created a superposition of events. In each timeline, a different person killed Lena for a different reason. All of them happened. None of them is more real than the others. The game has no canonical answer to its central question because having one would betray its thesis.

## VIII. OPEN QUESTIONS AND AREAS TO DEVELOP

These are not gaps. They are invitations. Every question here is a door the design team should walk through together.

**Narrative Structure**: How many authored case branches per suspect are needed before Case Refraction feels genuinely revelatory? The current estimate is four per major suspect (one per psyche archetype), but playtesting may reveal that hybrid builds need their own variations.

**The Detective's Interiority**: How much does the detective remember between runs, diegetically? The current design says "nothing conscious, everything intuitive" — they don't remember previous runs, but they feel the weight of them. Is this sustainable across 30+ runs without the player feeling the detective is artificially naive?

**The Endgame**: When does the meta-case resolve? The current design implies a final run where all four psyche archetypes are simultaneously active (the "integrated" build), allowing the player to perceive the Pale Rift directly and experience the superposition of timelines. How does this work mechanically? Is it a boss fight? A dialogue sequence? A walk through a space that contains all previous runs simultaneously?

**Companion Dynamics**: If the Partner System stretch goal is realized, how do companion NPCs interact with Case Refraction? Does a companion with their own psyche profile see evidence the player can't? Does this create a two-lens system that complicates the epistemology further?

**Tonal Calibration**: Where is the line between melancholy and depression? The game's tone is sad but not hopeless. The emotional destination is "compassion for ambiguity," not despair. Playtesting will need to measure not just difficulty curves but *emotional* curves — are players moving toward compassion or toward cynicism?

**The Silence**: What does the game NOT say? What is communicated purely through absence — empty rooms, missing persons, redacted documents, songs that cut off mid-verse? The negative space of the narrative needs to be as carefully designed as the positive space. Where does the world crack? In the silences. Always in the silences.

*This Narrative Bible is a living document. It breathes. It contradicts itself in places, and that is by design — a narrative bible for a game about the unreliability of truth should not be entirely reliable. What matters is not that every detail is fixed, but that every detail is felt. The world of Revachol Nights is not a setting. It is a wound. And wounds, properly tended, become the most interesting part of any story.*

*Every mechanic tells a story. Make sure it's one worth telling.*
