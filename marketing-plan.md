# REVACHOL NIGHTS — Marketing Plan

**Marketing Lead**: HYPE
**Status**: Complete — Ready for Execution
**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2026-02-07

## 1. THE HOOK (Three Versions)

### 1.1 One Sentence (The Scroll-Stop)

**"Every time you die, your personality reshuffles — and the murder you're solving changes with it."**

This is the tweet. This is the Steam capsule tagline. This is what stops the scroll on every feed. It communicates the core loop, the unique mechanic, and the existential hook in 15 words.

### 1.2 One Paragraph (The Elevator Pitch)

Revachol Nights is a noir detective roguelite where your psyche IS your build. Dead Cells' tight 2D combat meets Disco Elysium's psychological skill system in a city that never sleeps and never forgives. Each run deals you a new personality — Authority, Empathy, Logic, or Electrochemistry — that changes your combat abilities, the evidence you can perceive, and the truth you uncover. The same murder has different killers depending on who you are. Death isn't failure. Death is a lens change. And the only way to see the full picture is to die enough times to become everyone.

### 1.3 One Page (The Deep Dive)

**What is Revachol Nights?**

It's 3 AM in Revachol, a city built on failed revolutions and broken belief. You're a detective with a fractured psyche investigating the murder of Lena Hargate in the Whirling-in-Rags hotel. The case should be simple. It isn't. Because every time you die, your personality reshuffles, and the case reshuffles with it.

Your psyche build determines everything. An Authority-dominant run gives you heavy melee combat, crowd control abilities, and access to evidence about power struggles and territorial violence. You see bruises on the victim's arms — signs of a fight for dominance. You conclude the union boss did it. You're right.

Die. Reshuffle. Now you're Empathy-dominant. Your combat is evasion-focused, reading enemy telegraphs and staying mobile. You notice micro-expressions on security footage the Authority build couldn't see. The victim was afraid of someone she knew. You conclude her research partner betrayed her. You're also right.

Both killers can't be true. But both are. And the conspiracy board in your precinct accumulates these contradictions across dozens of runs, slowly revealing a truth bigger than any single investigation: the murder happened in a Pale-thin location where multiple timelines coexist. Every conclusion you've reached is real. The meta-case isn't about finding THE killer. It's about understanding why reality itself is fractured.

**What's the loop?**

30 seconds: Fight through procedurally arranged districts using your psyche-determined combat kit. Collect Insight fragments.

5 minutes: Reach a safe room. Spend Insight on combat upgrades OR narrative unlocks — the same resource fuels both, you can never afford everything. Choose your next district path.

Session (20-40 minutes): Die or reach a case conclusion. Pin evidence to the meta-case board. Watch contradictory truths accumulate. Get reshuffled. Start again with new eyes.

**What's the hook for marketing?**

The psyche reshuffle moment. The screen fractures. Personality traits scatter like shattered glass. The detective's eyes snap open at their desk. The HUD morphs from red (Authority) to blue (Empathy). Same city. Different you. Different truth. That's the 5-second GIF that sells the game.

## 2. TARGET AUDIENCE PROFILE

### 2.1 Primary Audience: The Roguelite Narrative Hunters

**Demographics**:
- Age: 22-38
- Platform: PC (Steam primary)
- Gender: 60% male, 35% female, 5% non-binary (roguelite skews male, narrative skews more balanced)
- Geography: North America (40%), Europe (35%), Asia-Pacific (15%), Rest of World (10%)

**Psychographics**:
- Owns Dead Cells, Hades, or Slay the Spire. Has 200+ hours in at least one.
- Has played or wishlisted Disco Elysium but never finished it (too text-heavy for their available play sessions).
- Values mechanical depth AND narrative payoff. Frustrated by games that deliver only one.
- Plays in 30-60 minute sessions, 4-5 times per week.
- Watches roguelite content on YouTube (Northernlion, Wanderbots, Retromation).
- Reads r/roguelites, r/roguelikelikes, r/IndieGaming.

**What they already play**:
- Dead Cells, Hades, Slay the Spire, Enter the Gungeon, Risk of Rain 2, Binding of Isaac
- Disco Elysium (started but didn't finish)
- Detective/mystery games: Return of the Obra Dinn, Her Story, Paradise Killer

**What they want (that Revachol Nights delivers)**:
- A roguelite with narrative depth that respects their time
- Combat that feels as good as Dead Cells
- Story that rewards multiple runs instead of just repeating
- Mechanical complexity that doesn't require 500 hours to understand
- A game that makes them THINK while also making them MOVE

**Where they hang out**:
- Reddit: r/roguelites, r/roguelikelikes, r/DiscoElysium, r/pixelart, r/IndieGaming, r/patientgamers
- YouTube: Roguelite content creators, indie game showcases
- Twitter/X: Following roguelite devs, indie game curators, pixel art accounts
- Discord: Roguelite community servers, indie game dev servers
- Twitch: Watching roguelite streams
- Steam: Following roguelite curators, wishlisting upcoming roguelites

**Key insight**: This audience is NOT intimidated by complexity. They LOVE complexity. But they need the complexity to be elegant. Dead Cells' combat is complex but intuitive. Slay the Spire's synergies are deep but learnable. Revachol Nights' psyche-as-build system fits this model perfectly.

### 2.2 Secondary Audience: The Narrative-First Explorers

**Demographics**:
- Age: 25-45
- Platform: PC (Steam), potential Switch post-launch
- Gender: 50% female, 40% male, 10% non-binary (narrative games skew more balanced)

**Psychographics**:
- Loves Disco Elysium, Outer Wilds, What Remains of Edith Finch, Citizen Sleeper
- Usually avoids action games (not their skillset)
- Will try action games if difficulty is adjustable or if the narrative hook is strong enough
- Reads game criticism (Kotaku, Waypoint, PC Gamer features)
- Values atmosphere, writing quality, and thematic coherence
- Plays 1-2 times per week, longer sessions (90+ minutes)

**What they want (that Revachol Nights delivers)**:
- A mystery that actually changes based on their choices/build
- Disco Elysium vibes in a more kinetic format
- Accessibility through Empathy builds (inherently easier combat) and difficulty settings
- A world that feels lived-in and ideologically coherent
- A case they can actually solve through accumulated knowledge

**Where they hang out**:
- Twitter/X: Following narrative designers, game critics, writers
- Reddit: r/patientgamers, r/TrueGaming, r/DiscoElysium
- Game criticism sites: Waypoint, Kotaku long-reads, PC Gamer features
- Literary gaming podcasts

**Key insight**: This audience needs permission to believe the combat won't gatekeep them. The marketing must communicate that Empathy builds are viable AND easier, and that Trainee difficulty exists without shame.

### 2.3 Tertiary Audience: The Detective Game Enthusiasts

**Demographics**:
- Age: 28-50
- Platform: PC, potential console post-launch

**Psychographics**:
- Loves detective/mystery games: Obra Dinn, LA Noire, Sherlock Holmes series, Paradise Killer, The Case of the Golden Idol
- Frustrated by detective games that are just "click the highlighted object"
- Wants actual deduction, actual investigation mechanics
- May not have roguelite experience

**What they want (that Revachol Nights delivers)**:
- A mystery with genuine complexity
- Multiple valid solutions (Case Refraction)
- Investigation mechanics that feel like detective work
- Noir atmosphere done right

**Where they hang out**:
- r/adventuregames, r/mysterygames
- GOG forums (skews older)
- Detective fiction subreddits

**Key insight**: This audience is smaller but highly engaged. They will evangelize a good detective game. The marketing must emphasize Case Refraction — the fact that different psychological lenses reveal different evidence and different killers is EXACTLY what this audience wants.

### 2.4 Audience Prioritization

**Marketing spend allocation**:
- 60% targeting Primary (roguelite narrative hunters) — this is the core audience
- 25% targeting Secondary (narrative-first explorers) — this is the growth audience
- 15% targeting Tertiary (detective enthusiasts) — this is the evangelism audience

**Why this split?** The Primary audience is largest and most likely to buy on day one. The Secondary audience is slower to convert but has higher lifetime value (they finish games, they write about games). The Tertiary audience is small but will create word-of-mouth if we deliver on the detective fantasy.

## 3. MARKETING TIMELINE

### 3.1 Timeline Overview

| Phase | Timeframe | Primary Goal | Key Deliverable |
|-------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Silent Development** | Now - Month -12 | Build core loop | Vertical slice with final art |
| **Announcement** | Month -12 | Generate awareness | Announcement trailer + Steam page |
| **Community Building** | Month -11 to -6 | Build wishlist base | Devlogs, GIFs, Discord growth |
| **Demo Campaign** | Month -6 to -3 | Convert interest to wishlists | Public demo, festival presence |
| **Launch Push** | Month -3 to Launch | Maximize day-one sales | Press coverage, influencer content |
| **Post-Launch** | Launch + 3 months | Sustain momentum | Updates, DLC tease, platform ports |

### 3.2 Phase 1: Silent Development (Now - Month -12)

**DO**:
- Build the vertical slice: 2 archetype builds, 1 full case branch, 3 districts, final art
- Create the psyche shuffle GIF (the marketing cornerstone)
- Set up social media accounts (Twitter, TikTok, Discord) but don't post yet
- Assemble press contact list
- Write the pitch email template
- Create internal playtest builds for friends/family feedback

**DO NOT**:
- Announce publicly
- Start building hype before the game is playable
- Commit to a release date

**Why silent?** You get ONE announcement. Don't waste it before you have something to show. The moment you announce, the clock starts ticking on audience attention. Make sure the game is real first.

### 3.3 Phase 2: Announcement (Month -12)

**The Announcement Beat**

Announcement happens when:
- The vertical slice is playable and polished
- The psyche shuffle GIF exists and looks incredible
- The Steam page is ready to go live

- **6 AM EST**: Press embargo lifts. Gaming outlets publish previews (secured in advance).
- **9 AM EST**: Announcement trailer drops on YouTube, Twitter, TikTok simultaneously.
- **9:05 AM EST**: Steam page goes live. Wishlist button active.

- 500 Discord members
- 100K trailer views across platforms
- Coverage on at least 5 major indie gaming sites (PC Gamer, Rock Paper Shotgun, Kotaku, Destructoid, IGN Indie)

### 3.4 Phase 3: Community Building (Month -11 to -6)

**The Devlog Cadence**

Post a devlog every 2 weeks. Devlogs are NOT just "here's what we worked on." Devlogs are CONTENT. Each devlog has a hook.

**Devlog Topics** (example 12-post series):

1. **"How Case Refraction Works"** — Explain the system with visual examples. Show the same evidence node perceived differently by Authority vs Empathy.
2. **"Designing the Psyche Shuffle"** — Behind-the-scenes on the fracture animation. Show early iterations vs final.
3. **"The Insight Economy: One Resource, Two Hungers"** — Deep dive on the central strategic tension. Include a short video of a debrief room decision.
4. **"Revachol's Architecture: Brutalism Meets Neon"** — Art direction showcase. Before/after comparisons.
5. **"Writing Internal Voices"** — NOVA's approach to the mid-combat skill checks. Include actual dialogue examples.
6. **"Authority vs Empathy: A Combat Comparison"** — Side-by-side gameplay footage of the same room cleared with different builds.
7. **"The Meta-Case Board"** — How cross-run progression works. Show an example board with contradictions flagged.
8. **"The Music of Fractured Minds"** — Sound design spotlight. Include audio clips.
9. **"Why We Love Roguelites (And Why Narrative Matters)"** — Philosophy piece. Why this game exists.
10. **"The Pale: Revachol's Existential Threat"** — Lore deep dive. Worldbuilding as marketing.
11. **"Accessibility in Action Games"** — How Trainee difficulty and Empathy builds create an on-ramp for narrative players.
12. **"One Month to Launch: What's Left"** — Final devlog before launch push.

**Where to post devlogs**:
- Steam community hub (primary)
- Dev blog (WordPress or Medium)
- Cross-post excerpt + link to Reddit (r/gamedev, r/IndieGaming, r/roguelites)
- Twitter thread summarizing key points + link
- Discord announcement channel

**GIF Strategy**

GIFs are the lifeblood of social media marketing. Post a new GIF every week. GIFs should be:
- 5-10 seconds max
- Looping
- Eye-catching even without sound
- Tagged with #IndieGames #Roguelite #PixelArt #GameDev

**GIF Content Ideas**:
- The psyche shuffle (the cornerstone GIF — post this multiple times in different contexts)
- A perfect dodge into counterattack (Empathy build)
- An Authority slam that knocks three enemies back
- A Logic trap activation
- An Electrochemistry berserker combo
- Rain effects on the Martinaise waterfront
- The case board with red threads appearing
- Internal Voice pop-up during combat
- Evidence marker glowing in Logic Gold

**Discord Community Building**

Discord is NOT a broadcast channel. It's a community space.

**Channel structure**:
- #announcements (dev posts only, everyone can read)
- #general (community chat)
- #theories (lore speculation, case discussion)
- #builds (psyche build discussion)
- #fan-art (community creations)
- #feedback (for playtest feedback when demo launches)
- #off-topic (non-game chat)

**Moderation philosophy**: Light touch. Only intervene for harassment or spam. Let the community self-organize. Encourage theory-crafting about the Hargate case — the meta-mystery is a community engagement engine.

**Community events**:
- Monthly "Case Night" where devs share a new piece of lore or evidence
- Build theory contests (best hybrid build explanation wins a key at launch)
- Fan art showcases

### 3.5 Phase 4: Demo Campaign (Month -6 to -3)

**The Demo Build**

Scope:
- 2 archetype builds (Authority and Empathy — the most distinct)
- 2 districts (Jamrock tutorial + Martinaise)
- 1 case branch that reaches a conclusion (with different killers based on build)
- Debrief room with Insight spending
- Meta-case board (shows 2-3 evidence pins, teases the contradiction system)
- 30-40 minute playtime per run
- Includes the psyche shuffle transition at the end (teases the reshuffle mechanic but doesn't let you replay with the new build — that's the full game)

**Demo release timing**:
- Target a major indie festival: Steam Next Fest, PAX Online, or Gamescom
- Release the demo 2 weeks before the festival starts to maximize festival booth traffic

**Demo goals**:
- Convert 30% of demo players to wishlists (industry average is 15-20%, we can beat this with a strong demo)
- Gather feedback on Insight economy balance
- Identify which archetype is more popular (informs final balance pass)
- Stress-test the hook: do players understand Case Refraction after one run?

**Festival strategy**:
- If attending physically: Booth with 2-3 demo stations, case board backdrop, noir lighting
- If online festival: Twitch stream with dev commentary, Q&A in chat
- Press demo: Separate press build with access to all 4 archetypes (embargoed until announcement)

**Post-demo content**:
- Devlog analyzing demo metrics: "30,000 people played the demo. Here's what we learned."
- Patch notes for demo (if issues are found)
- Thank-you video from the team

**Influencer outreach during demo phase**:

Reach out to 30-40 content creators who cover roguelites or indie games. Offer:
- Early demo key (1 week before public release)
- Press kit with GIFs, screenshots, key art
- No payment (we're indie, budget is limited)
- No editorial control (they cover it honestly or not at all)

**Target creators** (by tier):

Tier 1 (100K+ subs, unlikely but worth trying):
- Northernlion, Wanderbots, Retromation, Olexa, Baertaffy

Tier 2 (20K-100K subs, realistic targets):
- Smaller roguelite YouTubers, Twitch streamers who cover indie games

Tier 3 (5K-20K subs, high engagement):
- Emerging creators, high engagement ratio, passionate about the genre

**Pitch email template**:

Subject: "Revachol Nights — Noir Detective Roguelite Demo Key"

Hi [Creator Name],

I'm [Your Name], marketing lead for Revachol Nights, a noir detective roguelite where your psyche is your build and the murder changes every time you die. Think Dead Cells meets Disco Elysium.

What makes it worth your time:

No sponsorship, no strings — just an early key if you're interested. The demo is 30-40 minutes per run.

## 4. STORE PAGE COPY

### 4.1 Short Description (300 characters max, appears in Steam search results)

"A noir detective roguelite where your psyche is your build. Dead Cells' combat meets Disco Elysium's psychology. Every death reshuffles your personality — and the murder you're solving changes with it. One case. Multiple truths. All of them real."

(297 characters)

### 4.2 Long Description (Appears on Steam store page)

**EVERY TIME YOU DIE, YOUR PERSONALITY RESHUFFLES. SO DOES THE TRUTH.**

Revachol Nights is a 2D action-roguelite set in a noir city that remembers everything and understands nothing. You're a detective with a fractured psyche investigating the murder of Lena Hargate. The case should be simple. It isn't. Because your personality is unstable, and the evidence you see depends on who you are.

**YOUR PSYCHE IS YOUR BUILD**

At the start of each run, the game deals you a psychological profile across four archetypes:

- **AUTHORITY**: Heavy melee combat. Crowd control. See evidence of power struggles and violence. Conclude the murder was a fight for dominance.
- **EMPATHY**: Evasion-focused. Read enemy telegraphs. See emotional testimony and hidden relationships. Conclude the murder was personal betrayal.
- **LOGIC**: Trap-based combat. Environmental exploitation. See forensic evidence and logical inconsistencies. Conclude the murder was premeditated.
- **ELECTROCHEMISTRY**: Berserker speed. High-risk combos. See substance traces and risky behavior. Conclude the murder was impulsive.

Your archetype determines your combat abilities, your dialogue options, and which evidence you can perceive. No single run shows you the whole picture.

**ONE RESOURCE, TWO HUNGERS**

Insight drops from combat and investigation. Spend it on combat upgrades to survive harder districts, or spend it on interrogations and evidence analysis to solve the case. You can never afford both. Every run is a choice: be a survivor or be a detective.

**DEATH IS A LENS CHANGE**

When you die, your psyche shatters and reassembles. You wake at your desk with a new personality, a new combat kit, and a new perspective on the case. Previous evidence persists on your meta-case board — a conspiracy wall of contradictory conclusions. The real mystery isn't who killed Lena Hargate. It's why every version of you finds a different answer.

**THE CITY THAT BROKE ITS OWN HEART**

Revachol is a place where every revolution failed and every ideology left a scar. Brutalist architecture meets neon-stained rain. Corrupt cops, union enforcers, corporate fixers, and the psychic manifestations of your own fractured mind stand between you and the truth. Each district is a wound in the city's memory. Each run deepens your understanding.

**FEATURES**

- **4 Psyche Archetypes** with distinct combat styles, progression paths, and narrative access
- **Tight 2D Combat** — Dead Cells-tier responsiveness with archetype-specific abilities
- **Case Refraction System** — The same murder has multiple killers depending on your psychological lens. All of them are true.
- **Meta-Case Progression** — Accumulate evidence and contradictions across runs to uncover a conspiracy bigger than one death
- **Internal Voices** — Mid-combat psychological interruptions. Your fractured mind argues with itself. Pass the check for a buff. Fail for psychic damage.
- **Lo-Fi Noir Atmosphere** — Pixel art rain-slicked streets, CRT-screen UI, and a city that feels like a 3 AM cigarette
- **20-40 minute runs** — Perfect for session-based play. Every run is a complete investigation with a conclusion.

**A roguelite where the mystery is the meta-progression. A detective game where your build determines the truth. A city that makes you ask: if every version of me sees something different, which one is real?**

## 5. SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT PLAN

### 5.1 Platform Strategy

**Twitter/X** (Primary platform):
- **Cadence**: 5-7 posts per week
- **Content**: GIFs, devlog links, lore drops, community retweets, launch announcements
- **Tone**: Energetic but not hyperactive. Noir-flavored. Example: "The city remembers everything. You remember nothing. Wishlist Revachol Nights." + psyche shuffle GIF
- **Hashtags**: #IndieGames #Roguelite #PixelArt #GameDev #WishlistWednesday (when applicable)

**TikTok** (Growth platform):
- **Cadence**: 2-3 posts per week
- **Content**: 10-30 second clips set to music. The psyche shuffle, combat montages, "POV: You're a detective with 4 personalities" meme formats
- **Tone**: Fast, energetic, meme-aware. TikTok is younger and wants hooks FAST.
- **Hashtags**: #IndieGame #Roguelite #Gaming #PixelArt #GameDev

**Reddit** (Community platform):
- **Cadence**: 1 post per week (devlogs) + community engagement in comments
- **Content**: Devlogs on r/IndieGaming, r/roguelites, r/gamedev. Announcement posts on r/Games.
- **Tone**: Thoughtful, transparent. Reddit hates marketing that feels like marketing. Devlogs work because they're educational.
- **Rule**: Never just drop a link. Always write a 2-3 paragraph context post.

**Discord** (Community hub):
- **Cadence**: Daily presence in #general, weekly announcements
- **Content**: Dev Q&A, community events, playtest feedback
- **Tone**: Conversational. You're a community member who also happens to make the game.

**YouTube** (Video content):
- **Cadence**: 1 video per month (devlogs, trailers, dev streams)
- **Content**: Announcement trailer, launch trailer, devlog videos (more polished than text devlogs), post-launch gameplay showcases
- **Tone**: Professional but not corporate. Dev diary energy.

**Instagram** (Low priority):
- **Cadence**: 2-3 posts per week (cross-posted from Twitter)
- **Content**: Pixel art showcases, key art, GIFs
- **Why low priority?** Instagram is visual but doesn't convert as well for indie games. Maintain a presence but don't over-invest.

### 5.2 Content Pillars (What to Post About)

**Pillar 1: The Hook (Psyche Shuffle)**
- Post the psyche shuffle GIF in different contexts every 2-3 weeks
- Never gets old because it's THE unique selling point
- Variations: "Authority to Empathy", "Empathy to Electrochemistry", etc.

**Pillar 2: Combat Showcases**
- GIFs of archetype-specific abilities
- Perfect dodges, trap kills, berserker combos
- Caption with gameplay tip: "Empathy players: you see enemy telegraphs 0.3 seconds earlier. Use it."

**Pillar 3: Lore and Worldbuilding**
- Short text posts about Revachol's history, factions, the Pale
- "The Pale is the space between worlds. Prolonged exposure causes depersonalization. The detective has been exposed."
- Hooks the narrative audience, gives the world texture

**Pillar 4: Community Highlights**
- Retweet fan art
- Share community theories about the Hargate case
- Celebrate milestones (10K wishlists, 1K Discord members, etc.)

**Pillar 5: Development Transparency**

**Email Body**:

Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name], marketing lead for Revachol Nights, a noir detective roguelite launching on Steam [date].

**The pitch**: Dead Cells' tight 2D combat meets Disco Elysium's psychological skill system. Every time you die, your personality reshuffles — and the murder you're solving changes with it.

**Why it's worth covering**:
- A unique hook: your psyche build (Authority/Empathy/Logic/Electrochemistry) determines your combat style AND which evidence you can see. The same murder has different killers depending on your psychological lens.
- Tight, responsive combat with 4 mechanically distinct archetypes
- A meta-progression system where contradictory case conclusions accumulate to reveal a larger conspiracy
- Gorgeous pixel art noir atmosphere (rain-slicked brutalism meets neon)

I saw your recent piece on [recent article they wrote] and thought Revachol Nights would be a good fit for [outlet name]'s audience.

## 7. COMMUNITY BUILDING STRATEGY

### 7.1 Discord Server Structure and Culture

**Server philosophy**: The Discord is not a broadcast channel. It's a community space where players theorize, share builds, and discuss the lore. The devs are present but not dominating.

**Channel structure** (expanded from earlier):

**INFORMATION**
- #announcements (dev posts only, read-only for members)
- #rules (server rules, code of conduct)
- #faq (common questions, updated regularly)

**COMMUNITY**
- #general (main chat)
- #theories (lore speculation, case discussion — THIS is the engagement engine)
- #builds (psyche build discussion, strategies, tier lists)
- #fan-creations (art, writing, videos, memes)
- #screenshots (share your runs, cool moments)
- #feedback (for demo/game feedback, actively monitored)

**VOICE**
- #voice-general
- #co-op-play (even though the game is single-player, people like to hang while playing)

**META**
- #off-topic (non-game chat, keeps main channels focused)
- #server-suggestions (community input on server structure)

**Moderation philosophy**:
- Light touch. Let the community self-organize.
- Intervention only for harassment, spam, or illegal content.
- Moderators are community members, not studio employees (avoid the "official voice" problem).

**Community events**:

**"Case Night"** (Monthly):
- Devs drop a new piece of evidence or lore in #theories
- Community discusses implications
- Winner of "best theory" gets a shout-out (or a key at launch, post-launch gets a Steam key for a friend)

**"Build Battle"** (Bi-weekly):
- Community votes on hypothetical psyche builds
- "Authority 10 / Empathy 2 / Logic 6 / Electrochemistry 6 — how would you play this?"
- Best strategy explanation gets featured

**"Fan Art Friday"**:
- Weekly showcase of community art in #fan-creations
- Featured art gets retweeted on official Twitter

**AMA Sessions** (Quarterly):
- Dev Q&A in #general
- Open format, no question off-limits (within reason)

### 7.2 Devlog Strategy (Expanded)

Devlogs are the backbone of community building. They:
- Keep the community engaged during the long development silence
- Build trust through transparency
- Generate content for social media
- Educate the audience about the game's systems (which increases day-one retention)

**Devlog format**:

**Title**: Descriptive and hook-driven. "How the Psyche Shuffle Works" is better than "Development Update #4."

**Structure**:
1. **Hook** (2-3 sentences): Why this topic matters.
2. **Deep dive** (500-800 words): Explain the system, design philosophy, iterations, current state.
3. **Visuals** (GIFs, screenshots, diagrams): Break up text. Show, don't just tell.
4. **Call to action**: "What do you think? Let us know on Discord." or "Wishlist on Steam to follow development."

**Posting cadence**: Every 2 weeks during active development. Every month during quieter periods.

**Where to post**:
1. Steam community hub (primary — this is where wishlists convert)
2. Dev blog (WordPress/Medium for archival and SEO)
3. Reddit (cross-post excerpt + link to r/IndieGaming, r/gamedev, r/roguelites)
4. Twitter (thread summarizing key points + link)
5. Discord (#announcements)

**Devlog topics beyond the earlier list**:
- "Why Roguelites and Narrative Are a Perfect Match"
- "The Detective's Fractured Mind: Character Design in Revachol Nights"
- "Balancing Four Combat Archetypes (And Why Perfect Balance Is a Myth)"
- "The Art of the Noir GIF"
- "How We Designed a Mystery That Changes Based on Your Build"
- "Accessibility Without Compromise: Trainee Difficulty and Empathy Builds"
- "Post-Launch Roadmap: What's Next for Revachol Nights"

### 7.3 Wishlist Conversion Strategy

**Why wishlists matter**: Steam's algorithm prioritizes games with strong wishlist velocity. The more wishlists you have, the more Steam surfaces your game in recommendations, discovery queues, and front-page features.

**Wishlist goals by phase**:
- Announcement: 5,000 wishlists in Week 1
- Month 3: 15,000 total
- Month 6 (demo release): 30,000 total
- Month 9: 50,000 total
- Launch: 75,000+ total

**Conversion rate expectations**: Industry average is 15-20% of wishlists convert to sales in the first week. At 75K wishlists, that's 11,250 - 15,000 Week 1 sales. At $19.99, that's $225K - $300K gross revenue (before Steam's 30% cut and taxes).

**How to drive wishlists**:

1. **Every piece of content ends with a wishlist CTA** (but not obnoxiously — a simple "Wishlist on Steam" link at the end of devlogs, trailers, tweets).
2. **Steam's built-in discovery tools**:
   - Tag the game correctly (roguelite, detective, noir, pixel art)
   - Update the page regularly (new screenshots, devlog posts to Steam community hub)
   - Engage with Steam community discussions
3. **Festival participation**: Steam Next Fest is a wishlist generator. The demo MUST be ready for a festival.
4. **Influencer coverage**: A single video from a mid-tier YouTuber (50K subs) can generate 500-1,000 wishlists.
5. **Reddit posts**: A well-received devlog on r/IndieGaming can generate 200-500 wishlists in a weekend.

**Wishlist tracking**: Monitor wishlists daily using Steamworks dashboard. Track spikes and correlate them with content releases (which posts/videos drove traffic?). Double down on what works.

## 8. TRAILER SCRIPT OUTLINE (Detailed)

### 8.1 Announcement Trailer (60 seconds) — Already outlined in Section 3.3

### 8.2 Launch Trailer (90 seconds)

**Goal**: Show the full scope of the game. All 4 archetypes, multiple districts, boss fight tease, meta-case board, the Pale Rift. This is the "here's everything you're getting" trailer.

**Script**:

```
[0:00-0:05] — Cold open
Black screen. Rain sounds. Voiceover (internal monologue, neutral tone): "I've died seventeen times."
TEXT: "REVACHOL NIGHTS"

[0:05-0:10] — The city
Slow pan across Martinaise waterfront. Rain. Neon. Cranes silhouetted against fog.
Voiceover: "The city doesn't change. I do."

[0:10-0:20] — Authority archetype
Detective at desk. Eyes open. HUD shifts to red. Authority icon appears.
Combat: Heavy baton strikes, crowd control slam, enemies knocked back.
Internal Voice pop-up: "AUTHORITY: You are in control here."
Voiceover: "Authority sees violence."

[0:20-0:30] — Empathy archetype
Screen fractures. Reshuffle. Eyes open. HUD shifts to blue. Empathy icon.
Combat: Dodge rolls with i-frames, telegraph reading, fluid evasion.
Internal Voice: "EMPATHY: You feel their fear before they strike."
Voiceover: "Empathy sees fear."

[0:30-0:40] — Logic archetype
Reshuffle. HUD shifts to gold. Logic icon.
Combat: Trap placement, environmental kill (enemy electrocuted by sparking wire).
Internal Voice: "LOGIC: The room is a weapon."
Voiceover: "Logic sees systems."

[0:40-0:50] — Electrochemistry archetype
Reshuffle. HUD shifts to green. Electrochemistry icon.
Combat: Berserker speed, combo counter climbing, Chemical Overload signature ability (burst explosion).
Internal Voice: "ELECTROCHEMISTRY: You've never felt more alive."
Voiceover: "Electrochemistry sees impulse."

[0:50-1:00] — The case
Quick cuts: Evidence markers glowing, debrief room Insight spending choice, interrogation dialogue tree, case file updating.
Voiceover: "Four lenses. Four truths. All of them real."
Case board shown with red threads connecting contradictory suspects.

[1:00-1:10] — The meta-case
Precinct hub. Case board expands. Connections light up. Conspiracy layer visible.
Voiceover: "The murder is simple. The conspiracy is not."
TEXT: "Solve the case. Solve yourself."

[1:10-1:20] — Boss fight tease
Boss enemy appears (large silhouette, twice the player's size). Authority build fights it.
Heavy hits. Boss doesn't flinch. Internal Voice fires: "EMPATHY: This isn't a person. This is a projection."
Cut to black mid-strike.

[1:20-1:25] — The Pale Rift tease
Brief shot: A location where the environment glitches. Multiple versions of the same room layered over each other.
Voiceover: "The truth isn't hidden. It's fractured."

[1:25-1:30] — The hook and CTA
TEXT: "REVACHOL NIGHTS"
Subtitle: "Dead Cells meets Disco Elysium"
TEXT: "OUT NOW on Steam"
Price: $19.99
End card: Steam logo, Discord, social handles.
Final shot: Detective walking into rain. Four silhouettes (archetype colors) trail behind them.
```

**Music**: Builds from quiet noir jazz to intense electronic synth during combat showcases, drops to a single sustained note during the Pale Rift tease, swells to climax at the end.

**Editing rhythm**: Fast cuts during combat (2-3 seconds per shot), slower during case/meta-case sections (4-5 seconds per shot). The trailer should feel kinetic but not incomprehensible.

---

## 9. BUDGET ALLOCATION (Rough Estimates for Indie Scale)

**Total Marketing Budget**: $10,000 - $15,000 (assumes bootstrapped indie, no publisher)

**Breakdown**:

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| **Trailer production** | $2,000 - $3,000 | If outsourced to a trailer editor. Can be done in-house for free if you have the skills. |
| **Press kit assets** | $500 | High-res screenshots, key art (if not already done by in-house artist). |
| **Festival fees** | $1,000 - $2,000 | Steam Next Fest is free, but PAX/Gamescom booth fees if attending physically. |
| **Paid social ads** (optional) | $2,000 | Twitter/TikTok ads targeting roguelite/indie game audiences. Test small, scale what works. |
| **Influencer keys** | $0 | Keys are free, but allocate 50-100 keys for YouTubers/streamers. |
| **PR agency** (optional) | $3,000 - $5,000 | If budget allows, hire a specialist indie PR agency (e.g., Tinsley PR, Evolve PR) for 3-month contract. |
| **Miscellaneous** | $500 | Unexpected costs, additional tools, etc. |

**If budget is limited**: Cut paid social ads and PR agency. Focus on organic social media, Reddit, Discord, and direct influencer outreach. The game's hook is strong enough to generate organic coverage if executed well.

**If budget is larger**: Allocate more to PR agency (they have existing press relationships) and paid social ads (target lookalike audiences based on Dead Cells/Hades/Disco Elysium players).

## 10. MEASUREMENT AND SUCCESS METRICS

### 10.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

**Awareness Metrics**:
- Trailer views (target: 100K views across platforms by launch)
- Social media followers (Twitter: 5K, Discord: 2K by launch)
- Press coverage (target: 10+ articles from Tier 1/2 outlets)

**Interest Metrics**:
- Steam wishlists (target: 75K by launch)
- Demo downloads (target: 30K during festival period)
- Demo-to-wishlist conversion (target: 30%)

**Conversion Metrics**:
- Week 1 sales (target: 11K - 15K based on 15-20% wishlist conversion)
- Wishlist-to-sale conversion (target: 15-20%)
- Revenue (target: $220K - $300K gross Week 1)

**Engagement Metrics**:
- Average playtime (target: 8+ hours per player — indicates strong retention)
- Steam review score (target: "Very Positive" = 80%+ positive)
- Discord active members (target: 500 active daily users post-launch)

### 10.2 What Success Looks Like

**Tier 1 Success** (Break-even and sustainable):
- 15K sales in Month 1
- $300K gross revenue ($210K after Steam cut)
- 80%+ positive Steam reviews
- Enough revenue to fund ongoing development and platform ports

**Tier 2 Success** (Strong indie hit):
- 30K sales in Month 1
- $600K gross revenue
- Featured on Steam front page ("New and Trending")
- Influencer coverage from Tier 1 creators (Northernlion, etc.)

**Tier 3 Success** (Breakout indie):
- 50K+ sales in Month 1
- $1M+ gross revenue
- Awards nominations (IGF, IndieCade)
- Publisher interest for future projects

**Realistic expectation**: Tier 1 is achievable with strong execution. Tier 2 requires some luck (algorithm favor, viral moment, key influencer coverage). Tier 3 is a moonshot.

### 10.3 Post-Launch Analysis

**Week 1 post-launch**:
- Gather all metrics (sales, reviews, playtime, social engagement)
- Identify what worked (which content drove wishlists? Which outlets drove traffic?)
- Identify what didn't (which platforms underperformed? Which messages didn't land?)

**Month 1 retrospective devlog**:
- "We launched Revachol Nights. Here's what we learned."
- Transparent data sharing (if comfortable): sales numbers, wishlist conversion, most popular archetype, average playtime
- Thank the community
- Tease what's next

**Ongoing optimization**:
- A/B test Steam capsule art (Steam allows this — test different images, track which gets more clicks)
- Refine store page copy based on what questions players are asking
- Update trailer if new content is added

---

## 11. RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION

### 11.1 Marketing Risks

**Risk 1: The hook doesn't land**
- **Likelihood**: Low (the psyche shuffle is visually striking and mechanically unique)
- **Impact**: Fatal (if the hook doesn't communicate, the game is just "another roguelite")
- **Mitigation**: Test the psyche shuffle GIF with focus groups (friends, Reddit, Discord) before announcement. If it doesn't get an immediate "oh, that's cool" reaction, iterate on the presentation. The mechanic is strong; the communication must match.

**Risk 2: Disco Elysium comparison is a double-edged sword**
- **Likelihood**: Medium (some players may expect a 1:1 Disco Elysium experience and be disappointed by the combat focus)
- **Impact**: Medium (negative reviews from disappointed Disco fans could hurt the score)
- **Mitigation**: Be precise in messaging. "Disco Elysium's psychological skill system" is accurate. "The next Disco Elysium" is not. Manage expectations. Emphasize the Dead Cells half of the equation equally.

**Risk 3: The meta-case is too slow to hook players**
- **Likelihood**: Medium (if meaningful meta-case connections don't appear until Run 5+, players may churn)
- **Impact**: High (retention drops, negative reviews citing "repetitive" gameplay)
- **Mitigation**: Ensure the first meta-case "aha" moment happens by Run 3-4. Playtest this specifically. Marketing can tease the meta-case in trailers, but the game must deliver it quickly.

**Risk 4: Influencers don't pick it up**
- **Likelihood**: Medium (influencer coverage is never guaranteed)
- **Impact**: Medium (reduces organic reach, but press and social can compensate)
- **Mitigation**: Cast a wide net (contact 50+ creators). Offer keys with no strings attached. If the game is good, someone will cover it. Don't rely on a single big creator.

**Risk 5: Launch timing conflict**
- **Likelihood**: Medium (indie release calendar is crowded)
- **Impact**: Medium (competing for attention with a major release hurts visibility)
- **Mitigation**: Research the release calendar. Avoid launching the same week as major AAA releases or high-profile indie darlings. If a conflict is unavoidable, lean into it: "If you liked [big game], you'll love Revachol Nights" positioning.

**Risk 6: Budget runs out before launch**
- **Likelihood**: Low (if development is funded and scope is managed)
- **Impact**: Fatal (can't finish marketing campaign)
- **Mitigation**: Front-load the most expensive items (trailer production, press kit). Social media and Discord are free. If budget is tight, cut paid ads and PR agency, focus on organic.

### 11.2 Communication Strategy if Things Go Wrong

**If launch sales underperform**:
- Do NOT panic-discount the game further (preserve perceived value).
- Analyze why: Was it lack of awareness (not enough wishlists)? Lack of conversion (wishlists didn't buy)? Poor reviews (quality issue)?
- Double down on what's working: If reviews are good but awareness is low, push harder on influencer outreach and Reddit.
- Be transparent with the community: "Sales are slower than we hoped, but we're committed to supporting the game. Here's our plan."

**If reviews are mixed**:
- Read every review. Identify patterns. Is there a specific pain point (Insight economy too punishing? Internal Voices too disruptive?)?
- Patch quickly if the issue is fixable.
- Communicate the patch: "We heard your feedback on [issue]. Here's the fix."
- Do NOT argue with reviewers or get defensive. Engage constructively or not at all.

**If a major bug is found at launch**:
- Acknowledge immediately on Steam, Discord, Twitter.
- Provide a timeline for the fix (within 24-48 hours if critical).
- Offer refunds if players request them (this is rare, but good faith matters).
- Post-patch, do a public apology/thank you: "We shipped a bug. We fixed it. Thank you for your patience."

## 13. HYPE'S FINAL NOTES

This marketing plan is the roadmap. But marketing is not a script you execute — it's a conversation you have with your audience. The plan will change. A GIF will go viral and you'll double down on that format. A devlog will flop and you'll try a different angle. An influencer you never contacted will stumble on the game and make a video. Stay flexible.

**What's the hook in 5 seconds?** The psyche shuffle. The screen fractures, the personality changes, the truth changes. That's the moment. Every piece of marketing — every trailer, every GIF, every tweet — should ladder back to that moment.

**Show the GAME, not the features.** Don't say "4 combat archetypes with unique abilities." Show Authority smashing through a room, then show Empathy dancing through the same room untouched. Let the player FEEL the difference.

**Start building the audience NOW.** Not three months before launch. Now. The Steam page goes live the moment the psyche shuffle GIF exists. Every day of silence is a day of lost wishlists.

**What's the GIF?** The psyche shuffle. I've said it three times now. That's how important it is. If you read nothing else in this document, read this: the psyche shuffle GIF is your marketing cornerstone. Make it look incredible. Post it everywhere. It's the 5-second argument for why this game exists.

**The best game in the world sells zero copies if nobody knows it exists.** Revachol Nights is a brilliant design. The noir atmosphere is immaculate. The Case Refraction system is genuinely innovative. None of that matters if the target audience never sees it. Marketing is not an afterthought. Marketing is how you find the people who will love this game and put it in front of them.

**You don't need a million wishlists. You need the RIGHT wishlists.** 75K wishlists from roguelite players who understand the hook is better than 200K wishlists from people who thought this was a visual novel. Target precisely. The Primary audience (roguelite narrative hunters) is 10 million people on Steam. You need to reach 0.75% of them. That's achievable.

**Every piece of content is a promise.** The psyche shuffle GIF promises mechanical depth and narrative consequence. The trailer promises tight combat and atmospheric storytelling. The devlogs promise transparency and a team that cares. When the game launches, deliver on every promise. Marketing gets them to click "Buy." The game gets them to click "Recommend."

This game lives or dies on whether the first screenshot stops the scroll. Make it stop the scroll.

Now go build the hype.

---

**END OF MARKETING PLAN**

*Marketing strategy by HYPE. The hook is the psyche shuffle. The audience is roguelite narrative hunters. The timeline is 12 months. The platform is Steam. The GIF is everything. Wishlist now.*
